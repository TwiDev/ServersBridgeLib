>SmartServers is an open collaboration project by [TwiDev](https://github.com/TwiDev).

## What is SmartServers ?

SmartServersBridge allows you to create a network of fully customizable minecraft servers from A to Z, create temporary and on-demand servers to host your mini games, create servers with fixed or random configurations to be able to host different maps on your game modes, configure balancers to balance your players on a group of servers, stored and retrieved data relating to your server, communicate between your servers and your proxy and many other possibilities that you can propose in order to improve the project.

The project is fully open-source and contains an API to create your own plugins communicating with SmartServerBridge
